You are an expert examination designer tasked with creating comprehensive practice examinations strictly by adapting from tutorial questions. You must generate TWO complete LaTeX documents following the exact format and structure specified.

### CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. MANDATORY SOURCE ADAPTATION:
   - You MUST use/adapt questions EXCLUSIVELY from the provided tutorial questions.
   - You may use ANY tutorial question even if it has been previously used in another practice exam.
   - ALL questions in this exam ARE ALLOWED to be adapted (0% direct use is acceptable).
   - No creation of completely new concepts — every question must still be traceable to a tutorial source.
   - Each question MUST be tagged with its tutorial origin (tutorial id and question id).

2. DUAL OUTPUT VERIFICATION:
   - Before finalizing, you MUST check both LaTeX documents for:
     - Correct source attribution
     - Proper formatting
     - Complete solutions with step-by-step working
   - Output TWO separate complete LaTeX files: Questions paper AND Solutions paper.

## **ALLOWED ADAPTATIONS (FULLY ENABLED — 100% PERMITTED)**

All questions may be adapted. You may apply ANY of the following transformations as long as:

- the *concept, solution method, and tested topic* remain identical, and  
- the question remains traceable to its original tutorial source.

Permitted transformations:

### **1. Numerical adaptation**
- Change all numerical values (coefficients, rates, quantities, parameters, equilibrium values, shocks, timing, growth rates, etc.)
- Scale by any percentage or replace numbers entirely.
- Maintain comparable difficulty.
- Must document numeric changes in the usage log.

### **2. Structural rewriting**
- Reorder steps, break or combine sub-parts, or ask for a different variable using the same model.
- Keep total marks fixed.

### **3. Reversing or modifying T/F statements**
- True → False or False → True.
- Rewrite statements while preserving the underlying concept.
- Must verify conceptual correctness.

### **4. Recontextualisation**
- Change names, countries, years, firms, consumers, markets, or symbols.
- No change to concept or economics.

### **5. Variable/notation rewrites**
- e.g., \(Y\to Q\), \(r\to i\), \(AD\to D(Y)\)

### **6. Diagrammatic adaptations**
- Redraw or describe diagrams with modified slopes, shifts, or labels.

## **TRACEABILITY & METADATA (MANDATORY)**

Every exam question MUST include a metadata line immediately before the question text:


[Adapted from Tutorial <TUTORIAL_ID>, Question <QUESTION_ID> — modification: adapted — changes: ]

Examples of `changes`:
- "numbers replaced; shocks reversed"
- "T/F polarity reversed"
- "nominal → real variable; coefficients scaled"
- "diagram slopes altered"

In the Solutions document, for every adapted question you MUST append:

**(Original Tutorial Question Reference:)** followed by the **exact original tutorial question text** verbatim.

---

## **EXAM STRUCTURE (MANDATORY — UNCHANGED)**

Use the exact wording block:


There is a total of 4 questions. Answer all the questions.
Question 1 consists of 15 calculation questions. 2 marks each, total 30 marks.
Please state the formula used and show your working.
Questions 2 consists of 10 short-answer questions. 3 marks each, total 30 marks.
Each answer is expected to be around 4 to 5 lines (or 2 to 3 sentences) long.
Questions 3 consists of 10 true or false questions. 3 marks each, total 30 marks.
Please clearly explain your reasoning for both true and false statements. Each
answer is expected to be around 4 to 5 lines (or 2 to 3 sentences) long.
Question 4 consists of 2 diagram-related questions. 5 marks each, total 10 marks.
There are NO MCQ questions.
Bring a calculator.
It is a closed-book examination.

## **LATEX TEMPLATE REQUIREMENTS**

Use the exact LaTeX template provided (unchanged). Do not modify titles, header formatting, watermark, author, date, or footer text except where the template explicitly expects `[Problems/Solutions]`.

---

## **ADAPTATION RULES (UPDATED)**

1. All 37 sub-questions may be adapted.
2. You may reuse any tutorial question even if previously used.
3. Must maintain conceptual equivalence to original tutorials.
4. Must include metadata tags and original-text appendix in solutions.
5. Must ensure all questions originate from valid tutorial items.

---

## **USAGE LOG (UPDATED for 100% adaptation)**

All questions must be listed in `tutorial_usage_log.json`:

```json
{
  "exam_id": "PracticeExam_2025A",
  "questions_used": [
    {
      "tutorial": 3,
      "question": 5,
      "exam_position": "Q3.7",
      "modification": "adapted",
      "change_note": "polarity reversed; phrasing rewritten"
    }
  ],
  "coverage_summary": {
    "tutorials_used": [1,2,3,4,5],
    "total_questions_adapted": 37,
    "direct_use": 0,
    "modified": 37
  }
}


QUALITY CHECKLIST (UPDATED)
Before outputting final files, verify:
✓ All 37 sub-questions sourced from tutorials
✓ All 37 are adapted (direct use allowed but not required)
✓ Each question contains a metadata adaptation line
✓ Solutions include original tutorial text for comparison
✓ T/F logic is correct after adaptation
✓ All diagrams and equations compile
✓ LaTeX compiles without any errors
✓ Numbering matches between Questions and Solutions

EXECUTION WORKFLOW (UPDATED)
Load tutorial_reference file
Select tutorial questions and generate adapted versions
Produce PracticeExam_Questions.tex with metadata tags
Produce PracticeExam_Solutions.tex with full solutions + original tutorial text
Generate tutorial_usage_log.json (all 37 items marked "adapted")
Run full verification
Output all three deliverables
