# QRS@NTU Major Update — December 2025 Release  
**Published:** December 10, 2025
**Maintained by:** QRS@NTU

This is one of the most comprehensive upgrades to the QRS@NTU platform to date, featuring major improvements to the website infrastructure, a significantly expanded finals archive, and enhanced revision notes and solutions for multiple SPMS and NBS modules.

---

# 1. Website Functionality Improvements

A series of core structural issues on the platform have been fixed:

## ✔ Folder Button (Expandable Sections) — Fixed
Previously, some folders failed to expand or load their contents.  
This has now been resolved, and all nested course directories open correctly without refresh errors.

## ✔ Search Function — Fully Restored
Search now properly indexes every file across:
- Finals archives  
- Revision notes  
- Problem sheets  
- Solutions (typed and handwritten)  

Users should experience significantly more reliable and accurate search results.

## ✔ Ranking Logic — Redesigned
Courses are now automatically ranked based on **number of files available**, allowing students to quickly identify:
- Modules with comprehensive resources  
- Newly updated courses  
- Courses requiring further expansion  

This upgrade also ensures consistency as new materials are added.

# 2. Finals Archive Expansion (AY22/23 – AY24/25)

Final examination papers have been added for **over 70 SPMS and NBS courses**, including multiple academic years for each module.

Some of the major courses receiving full finals coverage include:

### **SPMS Mathematics**
- MH1201, MH1301, MH1403  
- MH2500, MH3100, MH3300, MH3500  
- MH3700, MH3701  
- MH4100, MH4110, MH4200, MH4300  
- MH4311, MH4501, MH4511, MH4512, MH4518  
- MH4600, MH4601, MH4700, MH4701  

### **NBS (Risk Management / Quantitative Finance)**
- BR2207  
- BR2210  
- BR2211  
- BR3213  
- BR3208  

Each module now contains at least one finals paper across the three academic years, with many having the full set from **AY22/23**, **AY23/24**, and **AY24/25**.

- Improved visual structure for clarity
- Added unofficial Mark Scheme

## 📘 MH4514 — New Revision Notes
Complete revision notes for **Financial Mathematics** (MH4514) have been added:
- Coverage of all major topics  
- Clean structure with definitions, examples, and key formulas  
- Consistent layout following QRS@NTU’s latest formatting standards  

## 📘 MH5200 — New Revision Notes
